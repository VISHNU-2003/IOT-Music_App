Thanks a bunch for giving me this chance to enhance my logical chops and spruce up my React app styling with, IoTReady Company through Internshala.

<h1>Question: </h1>

Create a React app where:
- A user can upload audio files (e.g. mp3)
- Store the audio file using built-in Browser APIs
- Show a playlist and now playing view 
- User should be able to play any file from the playlist and the playback should continue to the next file in the playlist upon completion
- When page is reloaded, load the last playing audio file and continue playing from the last position.
- Use the standard built-in HTML audio player (not a third party player)

<h2>Solution: </h2>
